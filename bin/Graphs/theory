1.graphs(google maps)have edges
types ofedges-uni directional (can travel only one way)or un-directional/bi directional(can travel bothways)
2.Edges can have weights(kms,distance)
3. weights can also be negative

graphs are stored in 4 ways

1.Adjacency List (list of lists)
2.Adjacency matrix
3.Edge List
4. 2D matrix(Implicit graph)
